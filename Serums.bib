abstract="We present a novel method for automatically generating artificialtest data that are particularly suited for testing form-centric software applications with several thousand input fields. The complex validation rules for user input are translated to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), which is solved using an off-the-shelf SMT-solver. In order to exert pressure onto the software under test, the generated test data have to incorporate extreme and special values (ESVs) for each field. The SMT-solver is aided by a sophisticated graph-based cluster algorithm and by other heuristic methods in order to reduce the complexity of the CSPs. With further optimizations, the test data generator now routinely generates a complete set of test data records for large form-centric applications within less than two hours. The test data generator described here is operationally being used for automated tests of form-centric Web-applications, within an iterative development process emphasizing very early testing of software applications.",

Data Vault 2.0 includes architecture, modeling, methodology, and implementation best practices and standards that work with Big Data, relational, hybrid, and NoSQL systems. This chapter is helpful to those who are looking for new methods to constructing their enterprise business intelligence (BI) solutions or those struggling with the transition to Big Data, unstructured or multistructured data. As data variety and volume grows, businesses are constantly seeking a solution for {\{}BI{\}} and data warehousing that can grow and adapt; the topics in this chapter cover how the team can be agile, what it means to include Six Sigma, total quality management (TQM), and Scrum agility for best results, all within a framework that serves the enterprise {\{}BI{\}} efforts. },

@article{Silow-Carroll2012,
abstract = {An examination of nine hospitals that recently implemented a comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) system finds that clinical and administrative leaders built EHR adoption into their strategic plans to integrate inpatient and outpatient care and provide a continuum of coordinated services. Successful implementation depended on: strong leadership, full involvement of clinical staff in design and implementation, mandatory staff training, and strict adherence to timeline and budget. The EHR systems facilitate patient safety and quality improvement through: use of checklists, alerts, and predictive tools; embedded clinical guidelines that promote standardized, evidence-based practices; electronic prescribing and test-ordering that reduces errors and redundancy; and discrete data fields that foster use of performance dashboards and compliance reports. Faster, more accurate communication and streamlined processes have led to improved patient flow, fewer duplicative tests, faster responses to patient inquiries, redeployment of transcription and claims staff, more complete capture of charges, and federal incentive payments.},

abstract = {Big data has now become a strong focus of global interest that is increasingly attracting the attention of academia, industry, government and other organizations. Big data can be situated in the disciplinary area of traditional geospatial data handling theory and methods. The increasing volume and varying format of collected geospatial big data presents challenges in storing, managing, processing, analyzing, visualizing and verifying the quality of data. This has implications for the quality of decisions made with big data. Consequently, this position paper of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Technical Commission II (TC II) revisits the existing geospatial data handling methods and theories to determine if they are still capable of handling emerging geospatial big data. Further, the paper synthesises problems, major issues and challenges with current developments as well as recommending what needs to be developed further in the near future.},
