%%The story of Peter start with him having a hip replacement and now on his way home to recover. He is seeing a new medical physician and start the process of consent to enable the physician to receive details on his hip procedures and treatments required. Peter is now use a e-coach. The e-coach uses a third party to store the activity data. 

%%We have the complete journey with all the data from the e-coach as a data set. Our processes enable the smart health care record to amalgamate the different healthcare providers to with Peter's consent keep a complete record of his interaction with any health care requires during his journey.
