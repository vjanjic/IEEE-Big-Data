The Serums user authentication scheme will go beyond traditional "one-size-fits-all" practices towards adopting a personalised and adaptable multi-factor user authentication scheme 
which will be based on a flexible authentication paradigm [REF]. A first conceptual design of the proposed flexible user authentication paradigm is depicted in Figure X. Our approach attempts to provide a new user authentication paradigm that leverages upon theories in Cognitive Psychology 
(dual coding, episodic and semantic memory), which suggest that humans' episodic and semantic memories, 
represented as verbal and visual information, can be transformed into memorable and personal authentication secrets. Such secrets can be semantically similarly reflected on both textual and graphical password keys, and accordingly used complimentary based on user preference (Figure X). The paradigm relies on a single, open-ended, user-selected secret that can be 
reflected as a textual key and a graphical key.
