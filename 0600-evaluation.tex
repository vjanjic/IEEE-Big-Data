\noindent
We present an initial evaluation of the \emph{SERUMS} technologies presented in Section~\ref{sec:tech} on a use case based on the Edinburgh Cancer Data Gateway (ECDG).

%, described in Section~\ref{sec:useCase}. Sections~\ref{sec:smartPatientRecords} -- \ref{sec:diffPriv} demonstrate the use of the \emph{SERUMS} technologies on this use case.

%In Section~\ref{sec:tpole}, we show the ECDG data vault representing the smart patient record format. In Section~\ref{sec:dfp}, we show the synthetic data that was fabricated using the data fabrication technology, based on the format of ECDG data vault and additional correlations between fields of this format. We also verify how close the fabricated data is to the real data. In Section~\ref{sec:access}, we describe different access rights to the data, also demonstrating how blockchain can be used to regulate access based on these rights. In Section~\ref{sec:access}, we describe how the new authentication mechanisms can/will be used for the ECDG. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:dataanalytics}, we describe the application of privacy-preserving data analytics on the ECDG data, demonstrating increased privacy of the data while still being able to derive useful information from it.
